Adonis is a server moderation and management system created for the ROBLOX platform.

Uploaded to GitHub for collaboration and issue tracking.

NOTE: By default, the Adonis.rbxm file in this repo may have debug mode enabled. To disable it, open Adonis_Loader > Loader > Loader.lua and change DebugMode = true to DebugMode = false in the "data" table. I recommend using the Adonis_Loader model instead.



## How to load a custom version:
When DebugMode is enabled, the loader will try to load the MainModule from the same parent as the Adonis_Loader model instead of requiring the model by ID. This is how I test changes to Adonis before each update, hence why it's called "Debug Mode."

If you want to maintain your own version of the MainModule you need to either enable DebugMode in the loader script and have the MainModule in the same directory as the "Adonis_Loader" model (NOT in the model, just the same PARENT as the model) or you need to upload the MainModule to Roblox and change the ModuleId in the Loader script to your own module id.

If you don't know/can't figure out how to do either of the things I just mentioned, you probably shouldn't be messing with the module at all as you will undoubtably break something. In the event that happens, please do not send me messages asking what went wrong, how to fix it, or why your computer is on fire. I don't have time to fix broken code that you might be responsible for. If instead while working on your custom version you find existing bugs/bug fixes or come up with worthwhile changes to the script, feel free to submit an issue or pull request to help make it better for everyone :)
