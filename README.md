Adonis is a server moderation and management system created for the ROBLOX platform.

Uploaded to GitHub for collaboration and issue tracking.

NOTE: By default the Adonis.rbxm file uploaded in the root of this repo may have debug mode enabled. To disabled it, open Adonis_Loader > Loader > Loader.lua and change DebugMode = true to DebugMode = false in the "data" table.

When DebugMode is enabled, the loader will try to load the MainModule from the same parent it is currently in instead of requiring it by ID. If you wish to maintain a personal, modified, version of Adonis, setting DebugMode to true will allow you to do this.
